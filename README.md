# Simple JS Clock

It is a fun project which displays Current Time as Analog, Digital and other watch faces.

I just developed it for fun when I was getting bored :).


# How to Use it?

Just Clone the Code and Open `index.html` in your browser which supports `HTML5` with `CSS3` and `JavaScript` enabled!
